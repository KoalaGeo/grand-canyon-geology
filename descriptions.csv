"Yi", "Black, medium- to coarse-grained, olivine-rich diabase. Contains plagioclase, olivine, clinopyroxene, magnetite-ilmenite, and biotite. Diabase sills and dikes intrude all rocks within Unkar Group below Cardenas Basalt. Chemical variation diagrams indicate a potential common parentage between dikes and sills and the overlying Cardenas, but direct physical connection has not been observed, although isochron ages are basically identical at 1,070±70 Ma Hendricks and Stevenson, 1990. Sills range in thickness from about 65 ft (20 m) in Clear Creek at eastern edge of map area to more than 655 ft (200 m) near Bass Rapids in central part of map area.

"Ys", "Includes five informal members, in descending order: the Seventy Five Mile Rapid, Cottonwood Camp, Papago Creek, Ribbon Falls, and Surprise Valley Members, undivided Timmons and others, 2007. Consists of red, brown, purple and white, cliff-forming, fine- to coarse-grained, well-sorted quartz arenite and subarkose sandstone with siliceous cement. Upper massive sandstone shows dramatic contorted bedding. Unconformable contact with underlying Hakatai Shale truncates crossbeds and alluvial channel deposits.

In descending order, they are upper, upper middle, lower middle, and lower sandstone members. Upper member consists of red-brown and purple, fine- to coarse-grained, well-sorted, highly contorted, gnarly bedded sandstone capped by nondisrupted, flat-bedded, gray sandstone. Upper middle member consists of rusty-red, fine- to coarse-grained, highly contorted, gnarly bedded sandstone. Lower middle member consists of purple “freckled” (reduction spots), fine-grained, well-sorted, lowangle cross-bedded sandstone with local contorted beds in upper part. Lower member consists of purplish-red, coarse-grained, flat-bedded, arkosic conglomeratic sandstone. All members cemented with silica, making sandstone as hard as metamorphic quartzite, but unit is not metamorphosed. Angular unconformity separates cliff of red-brown Shinumo Quartzite from underlying slope of red Hakatai Shale, marked at truncated beds of the Hakatai. The Shinumo increases in thickness from 1,132 ft (345 m) at eastern edge of map area to 1,540 ft (470 m) at Shinumo Creek, central part of map area .", "GRI Source Map ID 1309"

"Zs", "Informally divided into, in descending order, the lower, middle, and upper members Elston, 1979. Lower member is composed of slumped blocks of dolomite surrounded by black shale exposed mainly in Sixtymile Canyon in eastern Grand Canyon.
